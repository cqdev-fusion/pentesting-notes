# SQL Injection
###### Summary from OWASP top 10
[OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
___

In general Web Applications construct SQL statements involving SQL syntax wriiten in a mix of programmer and user supplied data.

>eg:
>```sql
>	SELECT title, text FROM news WHERE id = $id

The __$id__ is input that is supplied by the user while the rest is supplied by a programmer. This makes the statement dynamic.

A user can try and make the query do extra actions by supplying *__"10 OR 1=1"__* changing the logic of the SQL statement modifying the __WHERE__ clause adding  a condition "OR 1=1"

### Three classes of injection attacks.

###### Inband:
>data is extracted by the same channel that is used to inject SQL code.
>Its the most straight forward in that the retrieved data is displayed directly in the application web page

###### Out-of-band:
>data is retrieved differently. (Eg: an email with the results of the query is generated and sent to the tester.)

###### Inferential or Blind:
>no actual transfer of data there is a capability to reconstruct the information by sending particular requests and observing the results of the DB server.

### How.

A successful SQL injection requires the attacker to craft a syntactically correct SQL query. If the application returns an error message by an incorrect query, then it may be easier to reconstruct the original query to understand the how to perform the attack correctly.
How ever, if the application hides the error details then the attacker would have to reverse engineer the logic of  the original query

### 5 common techniques

>###### Union operation:
>can happen in a __SELECT__ statement, making it possible to combine two queries into a single result/set.

>###### Boolean:
>use __Boolean__ conditions to verify whether certain conditions are True or False.

>###### Error Based:
>This forces the DB to generate an error possibly giving up some information upon which to refine the injection.

>###### Out-of-band:
>possible usage is making a HTTP connection to send results to a web server or email.

>###### Time Delay:
>relies on the database pausing for a certain amount of time then returning the results.
