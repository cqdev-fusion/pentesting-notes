# 5 common techniques
___
### Subverting Logic.
###### Scenario
User logs in with username and password.
###### Application process
Application checks against Username and Password in the db.
If both are present and match application will proceed.
If not then application will halt and possibly give a reason.
- Query could be something like this.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE Username = 'weiner' AND Password = 'bluecheese'
```
If the query is true then login is successful otherwise it is rejected.

###### Attack:
If SQL injection is present we can try this.
- Using the SQL comment syntax `'--`
>Place the comment syntax straight after a users name like so `Administrator'--` then place an empty string in the Password field.
If injection is possible this will comment out the `AND Password = 'bluecheese'` part of the query.
Query would look something like this: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE Username='Administrator`', by commenting out the rest of the query and if Administrator is in the DB then we will gain access.

###### Tips:
Start by breaking with ' ; " then try and get a True result, then buildup from there.
